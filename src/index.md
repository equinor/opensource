# Open Source @ Equinor 

## Some alternate layouts:

* [Break into multiple columns, column width at 20ems, font-size: 1rem + 0.3vw](/alt1)
* [Break into multiple columns, column width at 21ems, font-size: 1rem + 0.4vw](/alt3)
* [Center content when column reaches a max-width of 40ems](/alt2)

The two first options use algorithmic layouts, only one breakpoint is used to center align the headings when there are multiple columns. The last one is more traditional (and boring :P) with a centered box when the text gets too wide to read.

The second option does not break into two columns until the viewport is quite large, so that’s why the font-size had to be increased as well to maintain legibility.
