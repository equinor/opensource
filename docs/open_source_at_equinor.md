# Open Source at Equinor

In [Equinor](https://www.equinor.com/en/about-us.html) we develop open source
software.

Open source is both an individual strategy chosen by our projects, as well as a
strategic direction for software development in the company as a whole.


## Open and Collaborative
We do so, because we believe in _collaboration_. Collaboration with developers
and users, vendors and educational institutions, partners and competitors.
Within and outside our industry.

Open source is our most important tool in removing obstacles that prevent our
software development projects to collaborate freely.

This strategy increases our combined knowledge when developing software.
It gives us access to, and increases the possibility for, innovation.

An open development model enables a healthy and sustainable environment for our
projects, in a way we cannot achieve alone.

For our engineers, open source is the foundation of our modern IT platform and
not only speeds up the development process, but increases the flexibility and
security in our IT solutions.

For us as a company, open source software significantly reduces the risk of
vendor lock-in. It prevents situations where technical incompatibilities and
limited freedom in closed source products become a hindrance for our business
objectives.


## The value of receiving contributions
We benefit from contributions to our projects. This could be as a
direct improvement of the product, like bug fixes and new features.

Valuable contributions may also come in other forms.
Several of our open source projects are often targeted tools, developed for a
specific domain and purpose, for a small user group within our company.
However, when together with external communities, the combined user base is
able to collectively give the feedback and level of user interaction needed for
a healthy software development process.

After all, we see software as an expression of our current knowledge within a
domain - and the process of developing it as an integrated part of this
continuous learning process. Collaboration and receiving contributions lifts
that learning to outside our teams, outside our projects and outside Equinor.


## The value of contributing
Our product development is based on open source software.
We depend on open source components for our infrastructure, as well as the
tools and frameworks we use to build our own solutions.

Through contributions to open source projects, our projects are enabled to take
an active part in improving the products that _we_ depend on. We see this as a
valuable mechanism in fulfilling our IT strategy.
As we want to enable more collaboration in Equinor maintained projects, we also
seek to increase our engagement in projects maintained by others.


## Flexibility and autonomy
Any environment for collaboration is naturally shaped by the different parties
involved. A condition for getting the most value of such a collaboration, means
the freedom to adapt and take part in or create a community for its specific
purpose.

Our approach to open source software development, also means that our projects
and teams have the necessary freedom to decide how they want to form and
implement their individual open source strategy.

This includes choice of license, and other decisions on how the projects choose
to approach an open development model for their products.
